# react-tac-toe

My extended solution to the ReactJS beginners tutorial with most of the suggested improvements implemented.

This project is based on the [ReactJS](https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html) tutorial. I also implemented all the additional features except for the toggle to change the ordering of the history list, I thought that was kinda pointless. I also took it a step further and split the components into separate files since any serious project will do this and there were no clear instructions in the tutorial regarding default exports (that I could find quickly).

Any suggestions are welcome, as this is an implementation based on a tutorial I do not consider myself an expert with React.
